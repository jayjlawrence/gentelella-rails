Description:
    Installs sample Devise view and layout files into your project.
    Adds route for '/gentelella_auth/<page>.html' to access the sample pages but requires authentication

Example:
    rails generate gentelella:install_devise
or  rails generate gentelella:install_devise --force
     - to force overwrite
     - otherwise existing files will be untouched and sample file will have .gentelella extension
